# shoppinglist 
My pet project. This is a flutter app to help manage your shopping list. With emoji and other stuff

### Disclaimer 👀
When I realized that I had enough knowledge for my own pet project. 
I got to work right away. Looking ahead, this was a misconception. 
I'm a little embarrassed about this code, but writing it was a learning experience

## Description

An app to create, view, modify your shopping list

I even published it in the app stores.

I used hive (database) and provider packages in the app.
In the app, when you enter the name of a product, a memoji is automatically assigned to it. For example bread = 🍞 bread 

Most of the code was written by me intuitively and from the guides.
At the time I didn't know too much to do it well. The app works and it's already well 😅

When I get the urge to resurrect something dead, I'll rewrite the app and make it a thousand times cooler and two thousand times more advanced this time
